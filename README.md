# testq8ltxlightboxnotebook
trying to get a notebook that can do ltx lightbox q8 on kaggle
this is based on https://github.com/KONAKONA666/LTX-Video - I wanted to be able to run this on kaggle using t4 gpu since the normal version runs out of memory, but it's hard work!  Storing files here so we don't have to make them *every* single time.  
Python version (e.g., cp310 for Python 3.10) and CUDA version (e.g., cu121 for CUDA 12.1).
